Hello! My name is Jennifer Kral and I'm a Minneapolis based Web Developer. I primarily use the MERN stack for my web applications although I am always striving to incorporate new and improved technologies. 

I firmly believe that the way things are is most likely not the best way. Thus, I'm always striving to improve. Whether its by using better technologies, refactoring code, or re-imagining a project altogether.
